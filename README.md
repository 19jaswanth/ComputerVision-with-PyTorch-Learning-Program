# ComputerVision with PyTorch Learning Program
Computer Vision using PyTorch Learning Program by TinkerHub Foundation. [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) is an open source deep learning framework created by [Facebook AI research](https://ai.facebook.com). This learning program will cover the following,   

* Computer vision. 
* Pytorch framework. 
* Torchvision library. 
* Image classification and object detection. 
* Transfer learning. 

We will be extensively using the PyTorch docs for conducting this program. 

## General Program Structure 
Every 2 days we will share a chapter of the PyTorch docs in the morning. Participants should go through it. In the evening of the odd days we will give a task. On the following day there will be hangouts sessions with mentors. 

## Participants criteria 
* Should know object oriented programming and python. 
* Should know Git and GitHub. 
* Should know what is machine learning and some basics(different categories of ML, what is training ? What  is testing ? What is dataset..etc)

All the resources to get you started with the program is given in the resources folder. You can learn it and apply for the program!

## Program Schedule
### Day 1

Google meets with the following contents:

* Welcome note to TinkerHub Computer vision using PyTorch program. 
* Intro to PyTorch, navigate through PyTorch website.
* Reading documentations. Explaining the structure of PyTorch docs. 
* General structure of the Program.
* Prerequisites, installations, getting to know each other.
